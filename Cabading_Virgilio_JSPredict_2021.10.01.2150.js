// Using comments, Answer the predicted questions

// Predict 1: What will console.log state when this function is called?
function myBirthYearFunc(){
    console.log("I was born in " + 1980); //I was born in 1980
}

// Predict 2:  if the variable birthYearInput is 1980 
//             (aka var birthYearInput = 1980), 
//             and this function is called, what would the console.log state?
function myBirthYearFunc(birthYearInput){
    console.log("I was born in " + birthYearInput); //I was born in 1980
}

// Predict 3:  If var num1 = 10 and var num2 = 20
//             what would the console.log state?
function add(num1, num2){
    console.log("Summing Numbers!"); //Summing Numbers!
    console.log("num1 is: " + num1); //num1 is: 10
    console.log("num2 is: " + num2); //num2 is: 20
    
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    console.log(sum); //30
}
